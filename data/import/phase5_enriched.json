    "synopsis": "This Venomnibus collects the chaotic early 2000s era where multiple creators explored Venom's antihero status and introduced Toxin, the newest symbiote spawn. Daniel Way's Venom #1-18 (2003) attempts to establish Eddie Brock's ongoing series, while Venom vs. Carnage #1-4 births the Toxin symbiote bonded to cop Patrick Mulligan. Various Spider-Man tie-ins show Venom's uneasy relationship with the web-slinger. The era lacks the focused vision of earlier or later runs, with inconsistent characterization as Marvel struggled to define post-Lethal Protector Venom.",

    "synopsis": "Matt Fraction's ambitious but uneven Thor run spans from his early one-shots through the universe-shaking Fear Itself event. The omnibus includes his atmospheric Ages of Thunder mythological tales and Secret Invasion: Thor tie-ins before diving into Thor #615-621 and Mighty Thor #1-22. Fraction explores Asgard's integration into Oklahoma and introduces concepts like the World Tree's decay, but the run is dominated by Fear Itself #1-7, where the Serpent's hammers corrupt heroes worldwide. Also includes Kieron Gillen's beloved Journey into Mystery #642-644 featuring kid Loki. Fraction's Thor is hit-or-miss, elevated by strong artist collaborations.",
    "connection_notes": "Follows: Thor by J. Michael Straczynski Omnibus (Asgard's return). Fear Itself is a line-wide event affecting Avengers, X-Men, and more. Gillen's JIM leads to: Journey into Mystery by Gillen Complete Collection.",

These issues feature the duo's continued street-level adventures, though the storytelling becomes increasingly erratic as Marvel's focus shifted elsewhere in the mid-1980s. Completists will find character moments and supporting cast development, but this stretch lacks the energy of the earlier Claremont/Byrne or Mary Jo Duffy runs. The series ends with #125, closing a significant chapter in Marvel's street-level hero history.",
    "connection_notes": "Continues from: Power Man and Iron Fist Epic Collection Vol. 4. The series ends with #125, with the partnership not resuming until decades later in modern revivals by Coates and others.",

After the Superior Spider-Man arc (#17-19) strands Miguel in modern Marvel, David explores fish-out-of-water dynamics and corporate intrigue at Alchemax. Secret Wars 2099 #1-5 provides an alternate future glimpse, while the series proper builds to Secret Wars' universal collapse. The 2099 Unlimited material offers classic '90s backup stories with the full 2099 cast.",

Early issues establish Magneto (#1), the Sentinels (#14), and the core mutant metaphor, though the series hadn't yet found the cultural resonance it would achieve in the '70s.

    "synopsis": "The original Marvel run continues through Return of the Jedi and beyond. Star Wars #74-88 bridges post-Empire storytelling with the theatrical adaptation, as Duffy, Michelinie, and others navigate Luke's journey to Jedi Knight. Includes Annual #3 and the complete Return of the Jedi #1-4 adaptation. The series increasingly struggles with continuity as it attempts to tell new stories while awaiting the final film's release, resulting in uneven but historically significant material from Marvel's first Star Wars era.",
    "connection_notes": "Continues from: Original Marvel Years Vol. 4. This volume marks the transition to post-ROTJ storytelling in the original 1977-1986 Marvel continuity, essential for completists of the original run.",
