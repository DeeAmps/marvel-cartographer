She was depowered by Rogue (Avengers Annual #10, 1981), then gained Binary cosmic powers (UXM #164), lost most Binary powers, became Warbird, then Captain Marvel (Captain Marvel #1, 2012). Her power level fluctuates between 'very strong' and 'cosmic-level' depending on the story.",
    "fan_interpretation": "Carol's inconsistent power level is a frequent complaint. She can sometimes go toe-to-toe with cosmic threats, other times struggles with ground-level villains. The DeConnick run stabilized her identity as Captain Marvel but power scaling remains inconsistent across different books.",

    "description": "In X-Men #23 (1993), Mr. Sinister cryptically referenced a 'third Summers brother' beyond Cyclops and Havok. This mystery dangled for over a decade, with fans speculating it was Adam-X the X-Treme. It was finally resolved in X-Men: Deadly Genesis (2006) as Vulcan (Gabriel Summers).",
    "official_stance": "Gabriel Summers / Vulcan is the third Summers brother, as revealed in X-Men: Deadly Genesis #1-6 (2006) by Ed Brubaker. Vulcan was a secret X-Men member sent on a doomed mission to rescue the original team from Krakoa, and Xavier wiped everyone's memories of the event.",
    "fan_interpretation": "Many fans felt Vulcan was a retcon that created more problems than it solved — Xavier's memory wipe was morally damning and felt out of character. Some fans still prefer the Adam-X theory. The Deadly Genesis revelation was divisive because it undermined Xavier's integrity and retconned Giant-Size X-Men #1.",
    "editorial_context": "Fabian Nicieza planted the third brother hint in 1993 and intended it to be Adam-X the X-Treme, whose parentage (Shi'ar D'Ken + Katherine Summers) was being set up. When Nicieza left the X-books, the plot was abandoned. Ed Brubaker's Deadly Genesis (2006) created an entirely different answer. This is a case where creator departure led to a retcon of a retcon.",

    "description": "Norman Osborn (Green Goblin) was impaled on his own glider in Amazing Spider-Man #122 (1973) and stayed dead for 23 years. The Clone Saga (1996) revealed he had survived thanks to the Goblin Formula's healing factor and had been orchestrating events from Europe.",
    "official_stance": "Norman survived his impalement due to the Goblin Formula's regenerative properties. He faked his death, fled to Europe, and spent decades manipulating events from behind the scenes, including orchestrating the entire Clone Saga. This is established in Spectacular Spider-Man #250 (1997) and Spider-Man: Revelations.",
    "fan_interpretation": "Many fans consider Norman's return one of the worst retcons in Spider-Man history because his death in ASM #122 was one of comics' most sacred moments. Others accept it because Norman became one of Marvel's most compelling villains in his post-return appearances (Thunderbolts, Dark Reign, Dark Avengers). The quality of his later stories somewhat retroactively justifies the retcon.",
    "editorial_context": "Norman's return was driven by the need to provide a mastermind behind the Clone Saga, which had spiraled out of editorial control. The original Clone Saga had no clear villain, and Norman was retrofitted as the puppet master. His return broke the 'rule' that only Bucky, Jason Todd, and Uncle Ben stay dead in comics.",

This was one of the most hated retcons in Marvel history and was finally undone by Nick Spencer.",
    "official_stance": "As of Amazing Spider-Man #73 (2021) by Nick Spencer, the Sins Past storyline has been retconned away. The events were revealed to be false memories implanted by Mysterio and Kindred (Harry Osborn) as part of an elaborate scheme. In current canon, Gwen never had children with Norman Osborn.",
    "fan_interpretation": "Almost universally despised. Fans rejected the premise that Gwen would have an affair with Norman Osborn, viewing it as a violation of the character. Nick Spencer's retcon of the retcon was one of the most praised editorial decisions in recent Spider-Man history. Most fans pretend Sins Past never happened.",
    "editorial_context": "JMS originally intended Peter Parker to be the father, but editor Joe Quesada vetoed this because it would age Peter too much. Norman Osborn was substituted, creating a far more controversial story. JMS has publicly expressed dissatisfaction with how the story turned out. Spencer's retcon in 2021 was designed specifically to undo the damage.",

    "description": "For decades, the rule in comics was 'only Bucky, Jason Todd, and Uncle Ben stay dead.' Ed Brubaker's Captain America (2004) broke this rule by revealing Bucky survived the plane explosion and was recovered by the Soviets, who brainwashed him into the Winter Soldier assassin.",
    "official_stance": "Bucky survived the plane explosion over the English Channel. His body was recovered by Soviet operatives who replaced his missing arm with a cybernetic prosthetic and used him as a brainwashed assassin for decades, periodically placing him in cryogenic suspension between missions. Captain America (2004) #1-14 establishes this as canon.",
    "fan_interpretation": "Unlike most resurrection retcons, Bucky's return is almost universally praised. Brubaker crafted the Winter Soldier reveal so skillfully that it enhanced rather than diminished the original death. The Winter Soldier concept was compelling enough to sustain its own franchise and became the basis for one of the MCU's best films. This is the gold standard for how to bring a dead character back.",
    "editorial_context": "Brubaker pitched the Winter Soldier concept to Marvel and was initially met with resistance because Bucky's death was considered sacred. Editor Tom Brevoort approved it because the story quality was undeniable. The success of Brubaker's Captain America run and the subsequent MCU adaptation vindicated the decision completely.",
